📖 About the Project

This standalone web module serves as a dynamic learning artifact. It consolidates lecture materials into an interactive "immersive" format, replacing static documents with a responsive, app-like experience.

The content is divided into two primary sections:

Part I: Foundations: Focuses on business impact, cultural alignment, measurement (KPIs/OKRs), barriers to execution, and strategic frameworks (Balanced Scorecard, McKinsey 7S).

Part II: Emerging Tech: Explores how AI, Blockchain, RPA, and IoT are shifting strategy from static planning to dynamic, predictive systems.

✨ Key Features

Secure Access: Integrated password protection overlay to restrict content access.

Responsive Sidebar Navigation: Dual-part navigation menu that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

Interactive UI Elements:

Tabbed Interface: smooth transitions between lecture sections.

Accordions: "Simple," "Intermediate," and "Advanced" examples are collapsible to keep the interface clean.

Embedded Schematics: Custom SVG diagrams visualizing the "Business Impact Cycle" and "Strategy-Culture Alignment."

Active External Resources: curated hyperlinks to authoritative sources (Forbes, HBR, Gartner, etc.).

Tailwind CSS Styling: Modern, clean, and accessible design using utility classes via CDN.
